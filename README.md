you must have npm installed in your local machine, node comes with npm so if you want you can install it from [Node official website](https://nodejs.org/en/)

clone the repo on your local machine thru the command line

`git clone https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/open-source-for-good-directory`

and then run `npm i` to install all the dependencies needed to run this project

after that if you use a *linux OS* just run `npm start` and reach _localhost:8080_ on your browser to see the project

if otherwise you use a *windows OS* just open `package.json` on your editor and modify the start script as follows before running `npm start`

```
"scripts": {
    "start": "set NODE_ENV=development & webpack-dev-server",
```
